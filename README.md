🧠 About Me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer and computer engineering student with strong hands-on experience building scalable systems using Laravel, Django, and modern API architectures. I enjoy turning messy real‑world problems into clean, reliable backend logic.

My work lives at the intersection of:

solid database design,

secure and well-structured APIs,

and calm, readable code that future humans won’t hate.


I’ve worked in internship environments with real production systems, collaborated closely with frontend teams, and shipped features using Git-based workflows and Agile practices. Continuous learning is part of my daily routine, not a motivational poster.
